# icm-list-appender
Python tool that can append multiple icheckmovies.com lists to create "all editions" type movies lists. It can also trim lists to only include the first x entries of each list (given different versions of a single list), e.g. for creating lists like "top 10 of each year/user" (given different list submissions for a common subject).)
